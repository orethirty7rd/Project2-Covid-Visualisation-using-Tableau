# SQL-project-2-Covid-data-visualisation

This project builds on my SQL analysis of COVID-19 data. After exploring key metrics such as infection rates, death rates, and country-level trends using SQL, I imported the results into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The aim was to move from raw data exploration to an interactive visual story, making patterns in the pandemic easier to understand.

## Findings & Analysis
Global Summary (Top KPIs)
Total Cases: 150M+, Total Deaths: 3.1M, Global Death Rate: ~2.1%.
This means that out of every 100 people infected, around 2 died, showing the severity of COVID-19 on a global scale.

## Infection Rate per Country (Map)
Darker countries = higher infection rates.
Europe, North America, and parts of South America show the highest infection densities, while most of Africa and Asia appear lighter, indicating lower reported infection rates.
This could partly reflect differences in testing, reporting, and healthcare systems.

## Death Count per Continent (Bar Chart)
Europe and North America had the highest overall death counts.
Asia follows, while Oceania had very low deaths.
Possible explanations:
1. Higher elderly populations in Europe.
2. Earlier outbreaks and surges in North America.
3. Stronger containment in Oceania.

## Top 10 Countries by Average Infection Rate (%) (Line Chart)
Countries like Andorra, Luxembourg, Panama, and Qatar had the highest average infection rates.
Smaller nations (San Marino, Luxembourg) often show higher percentages due to their smaller population base.

## Insights
The pandemic’s impact was uneven across regions: developed countries with advanced testing often reported higher infection rates but also higher vaccination rollouts later.
Death rates don’t always follow infection rates; healthcare quality, demographics, and speed of response matter.
Visual storytelling (maps + trend lines) makes these differences clearer than raw numbers alone.
