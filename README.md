# SQL-project-2-Covid-data-visualisation
This project builds on my SQL analysis of COVID-19 data (Project 1). After exploring key metrics such as infection rates, death rates, and country-level trends using SQL, I imported the results into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.
The dashboard includes:
Maps showing the global spread of cases.
Bar charts comparing infection and death rates across countries.
Trend lines to visualise the progression of cases over time.
The aim was to move from raw data exploration to an interactive visual story, making patterns in the pandemic easier to understand.
